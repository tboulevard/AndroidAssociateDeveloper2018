# AndroidAssociateDeveloper2018

This repository was used to track what exam content I covered while studying for the Android Associate Developer Exam in 2018. Most of the below exam content is implemented in the Java app -- I opted to do this because the exam did not support Kotlin as of November 2018.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- If you plan to take the exam at a certain predefined time (for me it was Saturday 10 am), **I’d suggest you do the payment, subscription, and ID verification at least one day before taking it.** Actually, after you pay, you’ll be asked to scan either a passport or a driving license (not all countries driving licenses are supported), once you do you’ll have to wait for up to few hours to get verified. You won’t be able to take the exam before getting your ID verified.
