### Lesson Notes

**Lession 5**
- Prefer webp & PNG images for Drawable resources
- A 9-patch is a PNG image in which you define stretchable regions. Use a 9-patch as the background image for a View to make sure the View looks correct for different screen sizes and orientations. Save 9-patch files with a .9.png extension and store them in the res/drawable folder. Use them with the android:src attribute for an ImageView and its descendants, or to create a NinePatchDrawable class in Java code.
